# Pucker


Pucker is designed to be a headless PTT client for Bluetooth audio devices for the Raspberry Pi. It exists because I began working on solving a problem I had with [talkiepi](https://github.com/dchote/talkiepi), which in turn came from [barnard](https://github.com/layeh/barnard). Seems to keep in tune with the spirit.
